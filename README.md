GameclocK is a sober clock for chess, go etc. that can be used either on a laptop :
 - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> : Player 1 played
 - <kbd>Space</kbd> : Pause both clocks (draw proposal in a chess game)
 - <kbd>Numpad Enter</kbd> : Player 2 played

Or on a phone (in this case, the display is rotated 180Â° for both player to see the game.
 - Touch upper screen area : Player 1 played
 - Touch center area ("Pause") : Pause both clock (and show setting / reset buttons)
